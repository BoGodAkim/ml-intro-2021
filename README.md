# RS School Machine Learning course

- [First class](1_data_manipulations/Pandas_data_manipulations.ipynb):
I learned basics of Pandas using data about [students](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance) and use Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization.
- [Second class](2_linear_regression/seminar_and_homework.ipynb):
I learned Linear regression (Scikit-learn) and use it for [dataset about football players from FIFA 2019](https://www.kaggle.com/karangadiya/fifa19) to predict dribbling.
- [Third class](3_overfitting_regularization/overfitting_regularization.ipynb):
I learned about underfitting and overfitting and regularization of Linear regression.
- [Fourth class](4_feature_engineering_selection/feature_engineering_selection.ipynb):
I learned about Feature Engineering: Missing Values Preprocessing, Scaling , Log/Power Transformation, Categorical Features Encoding and Feature Selection, on dataset about wine and cancer from scikit-learn.
- [Fifth class:](5_classification_linear_knn/classification.ipynb)
I learned about KNeighborsClassifier and LogisticRegression on dataset about [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) and Gini Coefficient, RandomForestClassifier and Pipeline on [Porto Seguroâ€™s Safe Driver](https://www.kaggle.com/c/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction/data).
- [Sixth class:](6_trees%20and%20ensembles/rf_classifier.ipynb)
I learned about Tree, RandomForestClassifier and RandomForestRegressor and Grid and Random Search for Random Forest and use Joblib to speed up own function of RandomForestClassifier and compare with function from scikit-learn on [dataset from sonar](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Connectionist+Bench+(Sonar,+Mines+vs.+Rocks)).
- [Seventh class:](7_clustering/clustering.ipynb)
I learned Clustering (KMeans and AgglomerativeClustering) and TruncatedSVD, tSNE and UMAP on datasets of low quality handwritten digits from scikit-learn and [hight quality handwritten digits](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).
- [Eighth class:](8_evaluation_selection/comp.ipynb):
 I work on [datasets of students](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rss-top-performers-prediction) using all knows which I get before.
