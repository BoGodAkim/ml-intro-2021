# RS School Machine Learning course

- [First class](1_data_manipulations/Pandas_data_manipulations.ipynb):
I learned basics of Pandas using data about [students](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance) and use Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization.
- [Second class](2_linear_regression/seminar_and_homework.ipynb):
I learned Linear regression (Scikit-learn) and use it for [dataset about football players from FIFA 2019](https://www.kaggle.com/karangadiya/fifa19) to predict dribbling.
- [Third class](3_overfitting_regularization/overfitting_regularization.ipynb): 
I learned about underfitting and overfitting and regularization of Linear regression.
- [Fourth class](4_feature_engineering_selection/feature_engineering_selection.ipynb):
I learned about Feature Engineering: Missing Values Preprocessing, Scaling , Log/Power Transformation, Categorical Features Encoding and Feature Selection, on dataset about wine and cancer from scikit-learn.
- [Fifth class:](5_classification_linear_knn/classification.ipynb)
I learned about KNeighborsClassifier and LogisticRegression on dataset about [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) and Gini Coefficient, RandomForestClassifier and Pipeline on [Porto Seguroâ€™s Safe Driver](https://www.kaggle.com/c/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction/data).
